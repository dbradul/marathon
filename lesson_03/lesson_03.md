## Lesson3 - vars, operators, functions id and type [17]
- Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwkaKgNxfE
- Short recap [0]
    -   REPL, CLI, IDE
- How data is stored in memory [8]
    - var is a name to address a value
    - operators and operands
    - var is a reference and can be reassigned
    - 2 vars can reference the same data: id function
    - ___meta_
        - Add diagrams here or draw them during the lesson?
- Data types intro [3]
    -   Technically, everything is saved as 0 and 1. Type defines how to interpret them.
    -   For example a raw bytestream can be interpreted differently depending on its type:
        -   01001001001110000100110010001011101 -> 45621 as int
        -   01001001001110000100110010001011101 -> 123.45 as float
        -   01001001001110000100110010001011101 -> 'abcd' as string
    -   Types also defines a set of supported operations and data formats [3]
        -   float contains .
        -   string is embraced into "" or ''
        -   \+ and * operators are different for numeric and string tyes
            -   42+1=43 vs '42' + '1' = '421'
            -   42*2 = 84 vs 'abc'*2 = 'abcabc'
            -   More on strings later on
        -   Type can be determined with builtin func `type`
- Naming conventions [6]
    - snake_style
    - no transliterations
    - no Cyrillic symbols
    - no keywords
        - ```help("keywords")```
    - no builtin functions
        - ```
          import builtins
          print(dir(builtins))
          ```
        - demonstrate how hiding works with `id` or `print` functions
- H/w
    - 2\. What is the type of this value: 42
        -   Radio buttons:
            -   int
            -   float
            -   string
            -   syntax error
    - 3\. What is the type of this value: .2
        -   Radio buttons:
            -   int
            -   float
            -   string
            -   syntax error
    - 4\. What is the type of this value: "Python'
        -   Radio buttons:
            -   int
            -   float
            -   string
            -   syntax error
    - 5\. Which of the below var names are correct according to Python naming conventions?
        -   Checkboxes:
            - var_a
            - totalSum
            - ploschad_figury
            - id
    - 6\. What is the meaning of this assigment: a=b
        -   Radio buttons:
            -   data is copied from b to a
            -   a and b are pointing to the same data
            -   a and b are pointing to the same data, but b is deleted after the assignment
            -   incorrect syntax
