## Lesson2 - print function, IDE, 1st project [16]
-   *__info*
    -   It might be useful to start a new video with short recap of previous lesson to warm up students a little bit
-   Short recap [1]
    -   Installed Python
    -   tried to use REPL
-   Run code with CLI [6]
    - REPL doesn't save commands history after restart. Let's fix it!
    - Create a separate file, write 2+2
        -   Such files is called module
    - python \<filepath\>
    - Note that nothing is printed
        -   This is the difference between REPL and CLI
        -   It is intentional as we want to print results only explicitly
    - Add print(2+2), note the difference
        - We can do print(2+2) in REPL as well
        - about the 'print' function a little later
    - Experiment
        -   print(5)
        -   print(1.23)
        -   print()
        -   print('42')
        -   More on this later
-   Note that [2]
    -   no indentations
    -   no ; at the end
    -   each command in a separate line
    -   More on style: PEP-8
-   Use IDE instead of notepad: PyCharm vs VSCode [7]
    -   However, CLI has its drawbacks as well: no colour, no suggestions, etc
    -   So, let's use IDE
    -   IDE is just a more advanced notepad for developers to edit, run and debug code
    -   Install PyCharm or VSCode [2]
        -   Choose Community
        -   Default path for program files
        -   Create shortcut, associate files
        -   Confirm user agreement
    -   Create the 1st project and print "Hello world!" [3]
        -   Project is just a folder with logically united files, e.g. game or site.
        -   Choose a project path
        -   Leave defaults
            -   If interpreter is not found, show how to choose existing one
        -   In our case project consists of 1 file: main.py
        -   Explain the project structure
        -   Remove the file and create new one for demonstration purpose
        -   Empty file is correct Python module: let's run it!
    -   Run with IDE [2]
        -   Context menu: Run -> nothing is displayed
        -   print(2+2)
        -   Run -> 4 is printed
        -   Note how IDE starts your module: similar to what we did manually
        -   So IDE is just a useful UI wrapper around command line
-   H/w [0]
    - 1\. Create your 1st program that prints "Hello world!"
