# Python Marathon

### General thoughts
- This is a 12 lessons course for absolute beginners
- Each lesson should be up to 20 minutes long to keep students attention and maintain their engagement
- The course should be self-contained and doesn't require any assistance from the instructor
- The course assumes no prior knowledge of programming or Python 
- Integrity and completeness should prevail over scope to build a limited, yet solid foundation
- If needed, Jupyter notebook can be used for lessons starting from lesson 4 to save time typing code and make demo smooth and predictable
- Jupyter notebook can be attached to lessons materials, so that students can download it and play on their own in PyCharm or VSCode
- This course can be used as a reference: https://stepik.org/course/100707. "Good artists create, greate artists steal" :)

### Legend and conventions
- [N]: timing in minutes
- [?]: topic is optional
- ___meta_: information for the instructor, not a part of the lesson
- It is supposed to have a course page with Q&A section, where typical questions are answered
  - What kind of homework exist?
  - How to submit h/w?
  - How to interpret results?
  - etc
- H/w assignments are not explained in details during a lesson. This is to keep the lesson short and potentially change h/w assignments without changing the lesson
