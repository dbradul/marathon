# Python Marathon

### General thoughts
- This is a 12 lessons course for beginners
- Each lesson should be up to 20 minutes long to keep students attention and maintain their interest
- Integrity and completeness should prevail over scope to build a limited, yet solid foundation
- The course should be self-contained and doesn't require any prerequisite knowledge

### Legend and conventions
- [N]: timing in minutes
- [?]: topic is optional
- ___info_: information for the instructor
- It is supposed to have a course page with Q&A section, where typical questions are answered
  - What kind of homework exist?
  - How to submit h/w?
  - How to interpret results?
  - etc
- H/w assignments are not explained in details during a lesson. This is to keep the lesson short and potentially change h/w assignments without changing the lesson
