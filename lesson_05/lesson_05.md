    - 11\. What is the result of this expression: min(1, pow(2, 3), math.floor(min(1, -5.5)))
      - Radio buttons:
          - 1
          - 2
          - 6
          - -5.5
    - 12\. You need to calculate the area of a circle with radius `r`. Which of these expressions solves the problem: math.pi * r ** 2
      - Checkboxes:
        - math.pi * (r ** 2)
        - (math.pi * r) ** 2
        - r * math.pi ** 2
        - pow(r, 2) * math.pi
    - 13\. Submit a code that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle with sides `a`and `b`.
      - Complete the code:
      - ```
        a = 5
        b = 10
          
        # your code here
        ```
    - 14\. Submit a code that calculates and prints the length of a circle with radius `r`.
      - Complete the code:
      - ```
        r = 5
          
        # your code here
        ```
